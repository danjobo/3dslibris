### libcurl and mbedTLS (devkitPro portlibs)

  negotiate with current servers.
- libcurl: curl license (MIT/X derivative), https://curl.se/docs/copyright.html
- mbedTLS: Apache License 2.0, https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls

- `sdmc/3ds/3dslibris/resources/cacert.pem`, as published by the curl
  project (https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html) from Mozilla's root store.
- License: Mozilla Public License 2.0.
- Used to verify HTTPS servers. Replace it with a newer copy from that page
  when root certificates change.
